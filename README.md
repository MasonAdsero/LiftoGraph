### Installing Dependencies
The root `package.json` should **NOT** contain any `dependencies` or `devDependencies`. To install dependencies within a specific workspace, run `npm i [dependency-name] -w [package-name]` for production dependencies and `npm i --save-dev [dependency-name] -w [package-name]` for development dependencies. To find the dependency's name, visit the package's NPM page. To find the destination package's name, look at it's `package.json` and use the name listed there.
